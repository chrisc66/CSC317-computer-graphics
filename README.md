This repository contains my lab assignment submissions when taking the computer graphics course. Please only use for academic purposes, feel free to reference the logic, but do not copy-paste code directly. 

The directory structure in this repo is more complicated than you think. Each directory itself is another repo, however, some of them are not properly imported as submodules. There might be potential version mismatch when pulling
`libigl` library. Refer to below repos to get latest information on build instructions.
